# **Research Overview**

## **Initial Research Question**  
*What techniques can effectively enhance a large language model-based conversational agentâ€™s ability to accurately interpret and respond to documents containing both textual and tabular data?*

---

## **Purpose and Motivation**  
This research aims to explore methods for improving large language models (LLMs) in processing documents that contain both textual and tabular data. The primary goal is to develop a conversational agent capable of accurately interpreting and responding to documents with mixed data types.

---

## **Research Objectives**
1. **Identify Existing Techniques**: Explore current methods used to process a mix of textual and tabular data, analyzing their strengths and limitations.
   
2. **Develop New Methods**: Propose and experiment with innovative techniques to enhance the ability of LLMs to interpret and process combined structured (tabular) and unstructured (textual) data.

3. **Evaluate Effectiveness**: Test these techniques in a conversational agent environment, measuring improvements in accuracy, interpretability, and overall usability.
