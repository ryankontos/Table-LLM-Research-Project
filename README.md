# LLM-Table-Understanding-Research

## Introduction

This repository contains the research and development work for my thesis project titled **"Can Large Language Models Understand Tables Embedded in Text?"** The project investigates the capability of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, LLaMA, and PaLM to comprehend and effectively process tables that are integrated within textual documents.

### Project Overview

Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding and generating text. However, their ability to interpret structured data, such as tables embedded within text, remains an underexplored area. This research aims to address this gap by examining how LLMs can be leveraged to build conversational agents capable of assisting users in creating and managing documents with embedded tables, particularly through the use of Markdown.

### Objectives

1. **Assess LLM Capabilities**: Evaluate the current state of LLMs in understanding and interacting with tables within text.
2. **Develop Techniques**: Explore and develop techniques that enhance LLMs' ability to comprehend and manipulate tabular data.
3. **Build a Conversational Agent**: Utilize these techniques to build a conversational agent that can assist users in typing text and embedding tables using Markdown.
