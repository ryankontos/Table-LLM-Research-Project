# **Thesis Research Question and Overview**

## **Inital Research Question**  
*What techniques can effectively enhance a large language model-based conversational agent’s ability to accurately interpret and respond to documents containing both textual and tabular data?*

---

## **Purpose and Motivation**  
This research focuses on exploring methods to improve large language models in processing documents that contain a mix of textual and tabular data. The goal is to develop a conversational agent that can accurately interpret and generate responses from both data types.

## **Research Objectives**
1. **Identify Existing Techniques**: Explore current methods used to process mixed textual and tabular data and identify their limitations.
   
2. **Develop New Methods**: Propose and experiment with novel techniques to enhance LLMs’ performance in interpreting combined structured (tabular) and unstructured (textual) data.

3. **Evaluate Effectiveness**: Test these methods in a conversational agent setting, measuring improvements in accuracy, interpretability, and usability.
