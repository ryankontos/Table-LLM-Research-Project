1. **AutoGen as a Multi-Agent Framework**:
   - **AutoGen** is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of LLM applications by supporting **multi-agent conversations**. Agents are customisable, can be backed by LLMs, humans, tools, or a combination, and can autonomously interact with each other or with human users.
   - For my thesis, this approach provides a robust structure for creating **multiple agents** that interact to handle complex tasks involving tabular data. For example, one agent could focus on generating code, another on executing the code, and a third on interpreting results.

2. **Conversable Agents**:
   - AutoGen agents are "conversable," meaning they are designed to communicate with each other, pass messages, and respond based on the conversation's context. Each agent can be assigned specific capabilities, such as code generation or validation.
   - In my system, this could mean having specialised agents for **code generation** or **data cleaning**, each communicating to ensure that user queries about tabular data are correctly understood, executed, and returned as expected.

3. **Conversation Programming**:
   - The core paradigm introduced by AutoGen is **conversation programming**, where workflows are organised around agent interactions. Agents communicate using both natural and programming languages to solve problems collaboratively.
   - This structure could be essential for my project, where user queries are translated into a series of steps (e.g., parsing the question, generating and executing the appropriate code, validating the output), each managed by a different agent in the system.

4. **Human-in-the-Loop**:
   - AutoGen supports human involvement at various stages, allowing humans to intervene, provide input, or validate agent outputs. This "human-in-the-loop" capability makes the system more flexible and adaptable.
   - In the context of my work, users might provide more context for a question, validate the code generated by the system before execution or correct a misinterpreted query about tabular data.

5. **Execution and Tool Integration**:
   - AutoGen agents can execute code and interact with external tools, making it possible to use the agents to generate, run, and validate code in real time. This functionality is built on top of LLM inference and includes advanced features like result caching and error handling.

6. **Flexible and Dynamic Conversation Patterns**:
   - AutoGen supports both **static** and **dynamic conversation patterns**. Static conversations follow predefined flows, while dynamic conversations allow agents to adjust their behavior based on the conversation context.
   - For my project, this flexibility is important, as different types of data queries might require different conversational patterns. For instance, simpler queries may follow a predefined path, while more complex queries involving error handling or ambiguous input might require dynamic, multi-agent problem-solving.

7. **Applications Demonstrating Multi-Agent Flexibility**:
   - AutoGen is applied in various domains, such as **multi-agent coding**, where agents work together to generate, validate, and execute code, as well as solve complex math problems or manage decision-making tasks. These applications show the power of multi-agent collaboration in complex workflows.
   - A system can be designed where agents collaborate to break down user queries about tabular data into smaller, executable steps, generate the appropriate code, run the code, and return the results to the user.

8. **Scalability and Modularity**:
   - A key benefit of the AutoGen framework is its modularity. Developers can easily create specialised agents for specific tasks and reuse them in different applications, promoting scalability.
   - For my system, starting with a few basic agents (e.g., for query generation and code execution) and then scaling up by adding more specialised agents (e.g., for advanced data analysis or error handling) will allow for the slow expansion of functionality.

### Example Applications for My Thesis:

- **Tabular Data Querying**: A user asks for a summary of sales data for a specific period. One agent generates the SQL query, another agent executes the query, and a third agent validates the output before delivering it to the user.
- **Error Handling**: If the SQL query fails due to a syntax error, one agent identifies the issue and another agent adjusts the query. The revised query is executed, and the corrected result is returned.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Users could manually approve or modify the SQL query before execution, ensuring the system handles ambiguous or complex queries accurately.
